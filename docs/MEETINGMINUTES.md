# CAB302 Project Meetings Minutes
## Tuesday 18/03/25 	

- Michael had come up with a rough UI planning of most of the app functions.

- Michael had broken down some of the app requirements in terms of user-driven, system-driven or AI-driven, to know the difficulty of each task and the approach needed to be taken.

- Decided to pitch the current idea to the tutors on Thursday and make any changes if necessary

- Start working on the user-driven requirements, such as the sign-in/up page and the main timer home page (without the AI additions yet)

- All 5 members were present in the call, but Ethan was a little busy so he couldn't engage much in the conversations



## Thursday 20/03/25

- Sriman and Shane had brought some sketches of how they wanted the UI to look, in addition to Michael’s idea.

- All 5 of us were told to at least come up with a different design each to provide various looks, where the best parts can be picked out to reach one satisfactory design.

- Preparations for the first project checkpoint, such as making sure everyone has contributed something to the remote repository, completed all 4 Java Readiness Modules on canvas.

- Start coming up with user stories; breaking the requirements we know for know into simple, nameable tasks/steps, to figure out where to start as a team and individually

## Thursday 27/03/25 (Checkpoint 1 Week 5)
-	Ethan couldn’t attend the checkpoint tutorial due to personal commitments, but emailed tutors regarding it prior.
-	Almost everyone has come up with a personal UI sketch
-	22 User stories have been stated, covering most of the core requirements and some for the additional features
-	Possibly add more user stories if needed
-	Checkpoint 1 went well; tutor very pleased
-	Now plan out Sprint 1: Finalizing a common front-end design (shared figma file has been created), and get started with code to create this front-end (possibly with empty nodes)
-	Everyone to come up with their own front-end ideas before next meeting (Tuesday 01/04), to then come up with the final idea in person.
-	Sprint 1 is expected to be completed by Checkpoint 2 (Thursday 10/04) 
-	Make a common task manager, to note these sprints and little to-do lists for the group


## Monday 31/03/25
-	Sharing UI ideas and coming up with an option for different themes as a feature (each theme is a colour combo of our choice)
-	Discussing the common structure and features that should be there, and could be there, and how we would implement them.
-	Decided app should be full screen to prioritize focus
-	Agreed to come up with a low/medium fidelity for the common structure 
-	Aim to get up main page and timer page on shared Figma file by Thursday

## Thursday 03/04/35 (Week 6)
-	Michael and Shane couldn’t attend the tutorial due to personal commitments
-	One uniform timer screen designed; other screens to be made following suit
-	One final medium fidelity UI to be ready for next week’s checkpoint
-	User Stories to be gone through as a team, and another iteration to be made, with everyone’s opinions and contributions (an agenda for next meeting)
-	Project Management tool (Notion) to be set ASAP, as a requirement for checkpoint next week, while also being a more efficient task list for everyone to refer to from here on (Keep Teams for discussions, Notion for statements)
-	Document what Sprint 1 was (Week 5 to 7) and have it ready for next week
-	Start thinking about the actual code; decide who to work on front-end and back end (Ethan is keen for back-end, Brian is neutral, Sriman more lenient to front end, Michael and Shane to state their interests)
