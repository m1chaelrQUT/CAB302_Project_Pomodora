# CAB302 Project Meetings Minutes
## Tuesday 18/03/25 	

- Michael had come up with a rough UI planning of most of the app functions.

- Michael had broken down some of the app requirements in terms of user-driven, system-driven or AI-driven, to know the difficulty of each task and the approach needed to be taken.

- Decided to pitch the current idea to the tutors on Thursday and make any changes if necessary

- Start working on the user-driven requirements, such as the sign-in/up page and the main timer home page (without the AI additions yet)

- All 5 members were present in the call, but Ethan was a little busy so he couldn't engage much in the conversations



## Thursday 20/03/25

- Sriman and Shane had brought some sketches of how they wanted the UI to look, in addition to Michael’s idea.

- All 5 of us were told to at least come up with a different design each to provide various looks, where the best parts can be picked out to reach one satisfactory design.

- Preparations for the first project checkpoint, such as making sure everyone has contributed something to the remote repository, completed all 4 Java Readiness Modules on canvas.

- Start coming up with user stories; breaking the requirements we know for know into simple, nameable tasks/steps, to figure out where to start as a team and individually

## Thursday 27/03/25 (Checkpoint 1 Week 5)
-	Ethan couldn’t attend the checkpoint tutorial due to personal commitments, but emailed tutors regarding it prior.
-	Almost everyone has come up with a personal UI sketch
-	22 User stories have been stated, covering most of the core requirements and some for the additional features
-	Possibly add more user stories if needed
-	Checkpoint 1 went well; tutor very pleased
-	Now plan out Sprint 1: Finalizing a common front-end design (shared figma file has been created), and get started with code to create this front-end (possibly with empty nodes)
-	Everyone to come up with their own front-end ideas before next meeting (Tuesday 01/04), to then come up with the final idea in person.
-	Sprint 1 is expected to be completed by Checkpoint 2 (Thursday 10/04) 
-	Make a common task manager, to note these sprints and little to-do lists for the group


## Monday 31/03/25
-	Sharing UI ideas and coming up with an option for different themes as a feature (each theme is a colour combo of our choice)
-	Discussing the common structure and features that should be there, and could be there, and how we would implement them.
-	Decided app should be full screen to prioritize focus
-	Agreed to come up with a low/medium fidelity for the common structure 
-	Aim to get up main page and timer page on shared Figma file by Thursday

## Thursday 03/04/35 (Week 6)
-	Michael and Shane couldn’t attend the tutorial due to personal commitments
-	One uniform timer screen designed; other screens to be made following suit
-	One final medium fidelity UI to be ready for next week’s checkpoint
-	User Stories to be gone through as a team, and another iteration to be made, with everyone’s opinions and contributions (an agenda for next meeting)
-	Project Management tool (Notion) to be set ASAP, as a requirement for checkpoint next week, while also being a more efficient task list for everyone to refer to from here on (Keep Teams for discussions, Notion for statements)
-	Document what Sprint 1 was (Week 5 to 7) and have it ready for next week
-	Start thinking about the actual code; decide who to work on front-end and back end (Ethan is keen for back-end, Brian is neutral, Sriman more lenient to front end, Michael and Shane to state their interests)

## Tuesday 08/04/2025 
-	Confirmed User Stories
-	Shane set up an Education shared-Figma group 
-	Michael Set up Notion, the User Stories file, Minutes file were added
-	Sprint Plan 1 was documented 
-	Home Page was discussed and drawn together
-	Task description pop-up box discussed
-	Idea of combining Profile and Progress Report Screen together
-	Plan on coming up with the final screen to show for the checkpoint on Thursday (10/04)

## Thursday 10/04/2025 (Checkpoint 2 Week 7)
-	Checkpoint went well; satisfactory User stories, project management tool and Medium fidelity UI
-	Start user stories 1-8 (the must-haves), aim to have the sign-in/up page fully functional with a linked user database for the next checkpoint
-	Also work on main timer page, getting the basic functionality (that doesn’t involve AI or external links, out of the way)
-	Have a online meeting during the break next week to discuss who will work on what
-	Fill out the mini tasks for Sprint Plan 2 on Notion for now

## Thursday 17/04/2025 (Mid-Semester Break Week)
-	Planning to finish back-end for sign-in/sign-up page with a connected user database for the checkpoint in week 9 (01/05)
-	Create the front-end for the timer page
-	Create back-end for timer page (start, stop, reset, edit, skip to next timer, choose default timer or custom timer)
-	Create the Home page (front-end and back-end); change the reports tab to 
-	Have a dummy study plan to show the custom timer (have a fake prompt just be saved in a database, manually create a tasks with mini checkpoints and a timer for it)
-	Create a default timer page (front-end and back-end)
-	Add a route to go from the home page to a default timer page
-	Editing the timer needs to be in the preferences section, so a dummy settings page must be done as well (with a working timer settings pop up window)
-	Brian is working on an Entity Relationship Diagram for the data structure; Michael is also breaking the down the structure of a sample study plan and checkpoints etc. so they have been advised to work together to get a clear data structure diagram out quicker.
-	Sriman will make a start on designing the front end for the home page and timer page in collaboration with Shane 
-	Sriman will update the task breakdown on Notion, with categorized tasks and managed swimlanes, and due dates for each tasks to be completed.
-	Get confirmation with every member on their tasks to complete.

## Tuesday 22/04/2025
-	Everyone was present for an in-person meeting
-	Just went over current objectives for front-end and back-end teams respectively by the end of the sprint (Week 9 Checkpoint 01/05)
-	Michael let the whole team know where our app was at now
-	Sign-in page front-end has been created and linked to a back-end that uses a mock database to create and store users.
-	Shane, Sriman and Brian (front-end team partly with Brian) discussed the approach for creating the pages and delegating tasks
-	Michael, Brian and Ethan (back-end team) discussed approach for functionalities to be made simultaneously with front-end team for spontaneous implementation.
-	Work to be continued at a faster pace throughout the week

## Thursday 24/04/2025 (Week 8)
