# Project Structure
This project was generated by the IntelliJ Idea JavaFX wizard, and then refactored for maintainability and clarity.

It follows an MVC structure.

## Controllers 
- Page controllers should all extend the `ControllerSkeleton` class
- The `ControllerSkeleton` class contains common methods for all classes, such as the implementation of scene-wide scaling based on window size, initialisation, etc

## Themes
- Themes are defined by the config enum `Theme`, and managed by util singleton `ThemeManager`
- It works by first applying the base theme css, and then applying the specific theme over the top in order to override any differences.

See more about [how to extend the theme management, or create new themes](theme-management.md)

## Pages
- Pages created must follow a specific layout due to some quirks with how JavaFX handles css
- A page should have a Controller and an FXML file (as per the MVC paradigm)
