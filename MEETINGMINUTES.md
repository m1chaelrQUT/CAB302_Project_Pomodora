CAB302 Project Meetings Minutes
Tuesday 18/03/25 	
•	Michael had come up with a rough UI planning of most of the app functions.
•	Michael had broken down some of the app requirements in terms of user-driven, system-driven or AI-driven, to know the difficulty of each task and the approach needed to be taken.
•	Decided to pitch the current idea to the tutors on Thursday and make any changes if necessary
•	Start working on the user-driven requirements, such as the sign-in/up page and the main timer home page (without the AI additions yet)
•	All 5 members were present in the call, but Ethan was a little busy so he couldn't engage much in the conversations

Thursday 20/03/25
•	Sriman and Shane had brought some sketches of how they wanted the UI to look, in addition to Michael’s idea.
•	All 5 of us were told to at least come up with a different design each to provide various looks, where the best parts can be picked out to reach one satisfactory design.
•	Preparations for the first project checkpoint, such as making sure everyone has contributed something to the remote repository, completed all 4 Java Readiness Modules on canvas.
•	Start coming up with user stories; breaking the requirements we know for know into simple, nameable tasks/steps, to figure out where to start as a team and individually
